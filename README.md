# ML2019b1 Machine learning for summer 19 first batch 10th may
this repo is device into multiple branche please check branch section here

##  getting  started  with basic of python libraries
use this github repo very efficiently and try to explore things in very ordered and easy way.

###  Prerequisites 
use pip3  to install with non root user in ubuntu 
```
sudo pip3 install numpy  pandas matplotlib mpld3 searborn
``` 

###  HEer is the Random Forest 
using ensemble to for prediction
** Ensemble means using multiple or single on dataset by small chunk of data to make random tree
   and those tree'w we can use to predict **

For more updates and information about random forest use wiki 
> wiki random forest

**  use below given scikit-learn funtions / class to explore 
- from sklearn.ensemble  import  RandomForestClassifier
- import  pandas as pd
- import numpy  as np
- from  sklearn.preprocessing  import StandardScaler
- from sklearn.metrics  import  accuracy_score
